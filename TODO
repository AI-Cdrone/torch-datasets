* create a pipeline from table of options

* support transforming dataset either once on construction or for every sample
or mini-batch on the fly

* add fully randomized mini-batches (copy in samples)

* implement randomized animations

* modify animation transforms to be random transforms that take {min,max}

* use old mnist animate function to add randomized animation support

* add pipeline args to TableDataset, sampler

* modify sampler to take a batch size, and option for truly random batches

* add ability to request items by class, or get a class specific sampler
